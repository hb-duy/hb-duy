Hello 👋 <br /><br />
🏠 Welcome to my Github profile. <br />
I'm Duy, a full-stack developer at heart with an eye for good design and expertise in all parts of the stack including the frontend, backend, databases, devops and cloud.
I have two decades of experience working, worked with a variety of technologies including C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Go, React, React Native, 
MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS, GCP, Docker, Terraform, and many others. 
I have worked in a variety of domains and have worn many different hats. 
This has given me a broad perspective and a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle.
